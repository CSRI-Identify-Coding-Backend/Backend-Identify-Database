    <h4>Explanation about the questionnaire, what to do; what to expect...</h4>
    <p>On the scale from 0 to 5 rated:</p>
    <ul class="a">
      <li>0: Incomplete process - The process is not implemented or fails to achieve its purpose.</li>
      <li>1: Performed process - The implemented process achieves its process purpose.</li>
      <li>2: Managed process - The level 1 performed process is now implemented in a managed fashion (planned, monitored ans adjusted) and its work products are appropriately established, controlled and maintained.</li>
      <li>3: Established process - The level 2 managed process is now implemented using a defined process that is capable of achieving its process outcomes.</li>
      <li>4: Predictable process - The level 3 established process now operates within defined limits to achieve its process outcomes.</li>
      <li>5: Optimising process - The level 4 predictable process is continuosly improved to meet relavant current and projected business goals.</li>
